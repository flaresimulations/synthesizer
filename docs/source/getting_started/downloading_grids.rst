Downloading Grids
=================

Synthesizer relies on pre-computed grids of spectra from stellar population synthesis models. Full details are provided in the `Grids <../grids/grids>`_ section of the documentation; here we describe how to download a simple test grid, which will enable you to run the examples and start to explore synthesizer.

Downloading the test grid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``synthesizer`` contains a simple command line helper tool for downloading the test grid. This test grid should not be used for production runs (please see `here <../grids/grids>`_ for details) but is sufficient for running the `examples <auto_examples/index>`_ and understanding the code. It is based on the BC03 stellar population synthesis model, and contains the stellar emission in the UV-optical on an age - metallicity grid.

To download the test grid, ``cd`` into the root synthesizer directory and run the ``synthesizer-download`` helper as follows:

    cd synthesizer
    synthesizer-download --test-grids -d tests/test_grid/ --dust-grid
