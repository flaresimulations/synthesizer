    :alt: Synthesizer

Synthesizer is an open-source python package for generating synthetic astrophysical observables. It is modular, flexible and fast.

This documentation provides a broad overview of the various components in synthesizer and how they interact.
To get started please take a look at the `getting started guide <getting_started/getting_started>`_, which contains download and installation instructions, as well as an overview of the code.

For detailed examples of what synthesizer can do, take a look at the `examples <auto_examples/index>`_ page.
Check out the `API <API>`_ for exhaustive details on all synthesizer functionality.

A code paper is currently in preparation. For now please cite `Vijayan et al. 2021 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.3289V/abstract>`_ if you use the functionality for producing photometry, and `Wilkins et al. 2020 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493.6079W/abstract>`_ if you use the line emission functionality.
