"""A module holding all photometric transmission filter functionality.

There are two main types of filter object in Synthesizer. Indivdual filters
described by a Filter object and Filters grouped into a FilterCollection.
These objects house all the functionality for working with filters with and
without a grid object.

Typical usage examples where trans is a transmission curve array, lams is a
wavelength array, fs is a list of SVO database filter codes, tophats is a
dictionary defining top hot filters and generics is a dictionary of
transmission curves:

    filt = Filter("generic/filter.1", transmission=trans, new_lam=lams)
    filt = Filter("top_hat/filter.1", lam_min=3000, lam_max=5500)
    filt = Filter("top_hat/filter.2", lam_eff=7000, lam_fwhm=2000)
    filt = Filter("JWST/NIRCam.F200W", new_lam=lams)  
    filters = FilterCollection(
        filter_codes=fs,
        tophat_dict=tophats,
        generic_dict=generics,
        new_lam=lams
