            with no extension.
        grid_ext (str)
            The grid extension. Either ".hdf5" or ".h5". If the passed
            grid_name has no extension then ".hdf5" is assumed.
        read_lines (bool/list)
            Flag for whether to read lines. If False they are not read,
            otherwise, this is a list of the requested lines.
        read_spectra (bool/list)
            Flag for whether to read spectra.
        spectra (array-like, float)
            The spectra array from the grid. This is an N-dimensional
            grid where N is the number of axes of the SPS grid. The final
            dimension is always wavelength.

            A dictionary containing the grid's parameters used in its

        axes (list, str)
            A list of the names of the spectral grid axes.
        naxes
            The number of axes the spectral grid has.

            A Grid will always contain 1D arrays corresponding to the axes
            of the spectral grid. These are read dynamically from the HDF5
