"""A module defining the Pacman emission models.

This module defines the PacmanEmission and BimodalPacmanEmission classes which
are used to define the emission models for the Pacman model. Both these models
combine various differen spectra together to produce a final total emission
spectrum.

The PacmanEmission model is used to define the emission model for a single
population of stars. Including both intrinsic and attenuate emission, and
if a dust emission model is given also dust emission. It includes the option
to include escaped emission for a given escape fraction, and if a lyman alpha
escape fraction is given, a more sophisticated nebular emission model is used,
including line and nebuluar continuum emission.

The BimodalPacmanEmission model is similar to the PacmanEmission model but
splits the emission into a young and old population.

The Charlot & Fall (2000) model if a special of the BimodalPacmanEmission
model and is also included. This model is identical to the
BimodalPacmanEmission model but with a fixed age pivot of 10^7 Myr and no
escaped emission.

Example:
    To create a PacmanEmission model for a grid with a V-band optical depth of
    0.1 and a dust curve, one would do the following:

    dust_curve = PowerLaw(...)
    model = PacmanEmission(grid, 0.1, dust_curve)

    To create a CharlotFall2000 model, you can use the following code:

    tau_v_ism = 0.5
    tau_v_nebular = 0.5
    dust_curve_ism = PowerLaw(...)
    dust_curve_nebular = PowerLaw(...)
    age_pivot = 7 * dimensionless
    dust_emission_ism = BlackBody(...)
    dust_emission_nebular = GreyBody(...)
    model = CharlotFall2000(
        grid,
        tau_v_ism,
        tau_v_nebular,
        dust_curve_ism,
        dust_curve_nebular,
        age_pivot,
        dust_emission_ism,
        dust_emission_nebular,
    )

    The Charlot & Fall (2000) emission model.

    This emission model is based on the Charlot & Fall (2000) model, which
    describes the emission from a galaxy as a combination of emission from a
    young stellar population and an old stellar population. The dust
    attenuation for each population can be different, and dust emission can be
    optionally included.

    This model is a simplified version of the BimodalPacmanEmission model, so
    in reality is just a wrapper around that model. The only difference is that
    there is no option to specify an escape fraction.
