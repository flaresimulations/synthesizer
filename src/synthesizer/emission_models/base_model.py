"""A module defining the emission model from which spectra are constructed.

Generating spectra involves the following steps:
1. Extraction from a Grid.
2. Generation of spectra.
3. Attenuation due to dust in the ISM/nebular.
4. Masking for different types of emission.
5. Combination of different types of emission.

An emission model defines the parameters necessary to perform these steps and
gives an interface for simply defining the construction of complex spectra.

Example usage:
    # Define the grid
    grid = Grid(...)

    # Define the dust curve
    dust_curve = dust.attenuation.PowerLaw(...)

    # Define the emergent emission model
    emergent_emission_model = EmissionModel(
        label="emergent",
        grid=grid,
        dust_curve=dust_curve,
        apply_dust_to=dust_emission_model,
        tau_v=tau_v,
        fesc=fesc,
        emitter="stellar",
    )

    # Generate the spectra
    spectra = stars.get_spectra(emergent_emission_model)

    # Generate the lines
    lines = stars.get_lines(
                line_ids=("Ne 4 1601.45A, He 2 1640.41A", "O3 1660.81A"),
                emission_model=emergent_emission_model

    """
    A class to define the construction of a spectra from a grid.

    An emission model describes the steps necessary to construct a spectra
    from a grid. These steps can be:
    - Extracting a spectra from a grid.
    - Combining multiple spectra.
    - Applying a dust curve to a spectra.
    - Generating spectra from a dust emission model.

    All of these stages can also have masks applied to them to remove certain
    elements from the spectra (e.g. if you want to eliminate young stars).

    By chaining together multiple emission models, complex spectra can be
    constructed from a grid of particles.

    Note: Every time a property is changed anywhere in the tree the tree must
    be reconstructed. This is a cheap process but must happen to ensure
    the expected properties are used when the model is used. This means most
    attributes are accessed through properties and set via setters to
    ensure the tree remains consistent.

    Attributes:
        label (str):
            The key for the spectra that will be produced.
        grid (Grid):
            The grid to extract from.
        lam (unyt_array):
            The wavelength array.
        extract (str):
            The key for the spectra to extract.
        dust_curve (dust.attenuation.*):
            The dust curve to apply.
        apply_dust_to (EmissionModel):
            The model to apply the dust curve to.
        tau_v (float/ndarray/str/tuple):
            The optical depth to apply. Can be a float, ndarray, or a string
            to a component attribute. Can also be a tuple combining any of
            these.
        generator (EmissionModel):
            The emission generation model. This must define a get_spectra
            method.
        combine (list):
            A list of models to combine.
        fesc (float):
            The escape fraction.
        masks (list):
            A list of masks to apply.
        parents (list):
            A list of models which depend on this model.
        children (list):
            A list of models this model depends on.
        related_models (list):
            A list of related models to this model. A related model is a model
            that is connected somewhere within the model tree but is required
            in the construction of the "root" model encapulated by self.
        fixed_parameters (dict):
            A dictionary of component attributes/parameters which should be
            fixed and thus ignore the value of the component attribute. This
            should take the form {<parameter_name>: <value>}.
        scale_by (str/list/tuple):
            Either a component attribute to scale the resultant spectra by,
            a spectra key to scale by (based on the bolometric luminosity). or
            a tuple/list containing strings defining either of the former two
            options. Instead of a string, an EmissionModel can also be passed
            to scale by the luminosity of that model.
        post_processing (list):
            A list of post processing functions to apply to the emission after
            it has been generated. Each function must take a dict containing
            the spectra/lines, the emitters, and the emission model, and
            return the same dict with the post processing applied.

        process of constructing a spectra. These different steps can be:

        - Combining multiple spectra. (combine must be set with a list/tuple
          of child emission models).

          and tau_v must be set)
        - Generating spectra from a dust emission model. (generator
          must be set)

        remove certain elements (e.g. if you want to eliminate particles).
