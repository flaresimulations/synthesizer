"""A module defining the emission model from which spectra are constructed.

Generating spectra involves the following steps:
1. Extraction from a Grid.
2. Generation of spectra.
3. Attenuation due to dust in the ISM/nebular.
4. Masking for different types of emission.
5. Combination of different types of emission.

An emission model defines the parameters necessary to perform these steps and
gives an interface for simply defining the construction of complex spectra.

Example usage::

    # Define the grid
    grid = Grid(...)

    # Define the dust curve
    dust_curve = dust.attenuation.PowerLaw(...)

    # Define the emergent emission model
    emergent_emission_model = EmissionModel(
        label="emergent",
        grid=grid,
        dust_curve=dust_curve,
        apply_dust_to=dust_emission_model,
        tau_v=tau_v,
        fesc=fesc,
        emitter="stellar",
    )

    # Generate the spectra
    spectra = stars.get_spectra(emergent_emission_model)

    # Generate the lines
    lines = stars.get_lines(
        line_ids=("Ne 4 1601.45A, He 2 1640.41A", "O3 1660.81A"),
        emission_model=emergent_emission_model

    """
    A class to define the construction of a spectra from a grid.

    An emission model describes the steps necessary to construct a spectra
    from a grid. These steps can be:
    - Extracting a spectra from a grid.
    - Combining multiple spectra.
    - Applying a dust curve to a spectra.
    - Generating spectra from a dust emission model.

    All of these stages can also have masks applied to them to remove certain
    elements from the spectra (e.g. if you want to eliminate young stars).

    By chaining together multiple emission models, complex spectra can be
    constructed from a grid of particles.

    Note: Every time a property is changed anywhere in the tree the tree must
    be reconstructed. This is a cheap process but must happen to ensure
    the expected properties are used when the model is used. This means most
    attributes are accessed through properties and set via setters to
    ensure the tree remains consistent.

    A number of attributes are defined as properties to protect their values
    and ensure the tree is correctly reconstructed when they are changed.
    This also means the they are no included below in the Attributes section
    to avoid duplication.

    Attributes:
        label (str):
            The key for the spectra that will be produced.
        lam (unyt_array):
            The wavelength array.
        masks (list):
            A list of masks to apply.
        parents (list):
            A list of models which depend on this model.
        children (list):
            A list of models this model depends on.
        related_models (list):
            A list of related models to this model. A related model is a model
            that is connected somewhere within the model tree but is required
            in the construction of the "root" model encapulated by self.
        fixed_parameters (dict):
            A dictionary of component attributes/parameters which should be
            fixed and thus ignore the value of the component attribute. This
            should take the form {<parameter_name>: <value>}.
        emitter (str):
            The emitter this emission model acts on. Default is "stellar".
        apply_dust_to (EmissionModel):
            The model to apply the dust curve to.
        dust_curve (emission_models.attenuation.*):
            The dust curve to apply.
        tau_v (float/ndarray/str/tuple):
            The optical depth to apply. Can be a float, ndarray, or a string
            to a component attribute. Can also be a tuple combining any of
            these.
        generator (EmissionModel):
            The emission generation model. This must define a get_spectra
            method.
        lum_intrinsic_model (EmissionModel):
            The intrinsic model to use deriving the dust luminosity when
            computing dust emission.
        lum_attenuated_model (EmissionModel):
            The attenuated model to use deriving the dust luminosity when
            computing dust emission.
        mask_attr (str):
            The component attribute to mask on.
        mask_thresh (unyt_quantity):
            The threshold for the mask.
        mask_op (str):
            The operation to apply. Can be "<", ">", "<=", ">=", "==", or "!=".
        fesc (float):
            The escape fraction.
        scale_by (list):
            A list of attributes to scale the spectra by.
        post_processing (list):
            A list of post processing functions to apply to the emission after
            it has been generated. Each function must take a dict containing
            the spectra/lines, the emitters, and the emission model, and return
            the same dict with the post processing applied.
        save (bool):
            A flag for whether the emission produced by this model should be
            "saved", i.e. attached to the emitter. If False, the emission will
            be discarded after it has been used. Default is True.
        per_particle (bool):
            A flag for whether the emission produced by this model should be
            "per particle". If True, the spectra and lines will be stored per
            particle. Integrated spectra are made automatically by summing the
            per particle spectra. Default is False.

        Generate images as described by the emission model.

        This will create images for all models in the emission model which

        limit_to is set to a specific model, in which case only that model
        will have images generated (including any models required for that
        passed model, e.g. a combination of AGN and Stellar spectra).

        Note that unlike spectra or line creation, images are always either
        generated from existing photometry or combined from existing images
        further down in the tree.

        Args:
            resolution (float):
                The pixel resolution of the image in spatial units (e.g. pc,
                kpc, Mpc).
            fov (float):
                The field of view of the image in angular units (e.g. arcsec,
                arcmin, deg).

                The emitters to generate the lines for in the form of a
                dictionary, {"stellar": <emitter>, "blackhole": <emitter>}.
            verbose (bool)
                Are we talking?
            images (dict)
                A dictionary of images to add to. This is used for recursive
                calls to this function.
            _is_related (bool)
                Are we generating related model lines? If so we don't want
                to apply any post processing functions or delete any lines,
                this will be done outside the recursive call.
            limit_to (str)
                If not None, defines a specifical model to limit the image
                generation to. Otherwise, all models with saved spectra will
                have images generated.
            do_flux (bool)
                If True, the images will be generated from fluxes, if False
                they will be generated from luminosities.
            kwargs (dict)
                Any additional keyword arguments to pass to the generator
                function.

            dict
