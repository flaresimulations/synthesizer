    The base Gas class. This contains all data a collection of gas particles
    could contain. It inherits from the base Particles class holding
    attributes and methods common to all particle types.

    The Gas class can be handed to methods elsewhere to pass information
    about the gas particles needed in other computations. A galaxy object
    should have a link to the Gas object containing its gas particles,
    for example.

            The gas phase metallicity of each particle (integrated)
        star_forming (array-like, bool)
