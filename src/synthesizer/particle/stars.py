"""A module for working with arrays of stellar particles.

Contains the Stars class for use with particle based systems. This houses all
the data detailing collections of stellar particles. Each property is
stored in (N_star, ) shaped arrays for efficiency.

We also provide functions for creating "fake" stellar distributions by
sampling a SFZH.

In both cases a myriad of extra optional properties can be set by providing
them as keyword arguments.

Example usages:

    stars = Stars(initial_masses, ages, metallicities,
                  redshift=redshift, current_masses=current_masses, ...)
    stars = sample_sfhz(sfzh, n, total_initial_mass,

class Stars(Particles, StarsComponent):
    """
    The base Stars class. This contains all data a collection of stars could
    contain. It inherits from the base Particles class holding attributes and
    methods common to all particle types.

    The Stars class can be handed to methods elsewhere to pass information
    about the stars needed in other computations. For example a Galaxy object
    can be passed a stars object for use with any of the Galaxy helper methods.

    Note that due to the many possible operations, this class has a large
    number of optional attributes which are set to None if not provided.

    Attributes:
        initial_masses (array-like, float)
            The intial stellar mass of each particle in Msun.

            Convenience attribute containing log10(metallicity).
        resampled (bool)
            Flag for whether the young particles have been resampled.

            particle in simulation length units.
