        Make an ImageCollection from fluxes.

        For Parametric components, images can only be smoothed. An
        exception will be raised if a histogram is requested.

        For Particle components, images can either be a simple
        histogram ("hist") or an image with particles smoothed over
        their SPH kernel.

        Which images are produced is defined by the emission model. If any
        of the necessary photometry is missing for generating a particular
        image, an exception will be raised.

        The limit_to argument can be used if only a specific image is desired.

        Note that black holes will never be smoothed and only produce a
        histogram due to the point source nature of black holes.

        All images that are created will be stored on the emitter (Stars or
        BlackHole/s) under the images_fnu attribute. The image
        collection at the root of the emission model will also be returned.

        Args:
            resolution (Quantity, float)
                The size of a pixel.
                (Ignoring any supersampling defined by psf_resample_factor)
            fov : float
                The width of the image in image coordinates.
            emission_model (EmissionModel)
                The emission model to use to generate the images.
            img_type : str
                The type of image to be made, either "hist" -> a histogram, or
                "smoothed" -> particles smoothed over a kernel for a particle
                galaxy. Otherwise, only smoothed is applicable.
            stellar_photometry (string)
                The stellar spectra key from which to extract photometry
                to use for the image.
            blackhole_photometry (string)
                The black hole spectra key from which to extract photometry
                to use for the image.
            kernel (array-like, float)
                The values from one of the kernels from the kernel_functions
                module. Only used for smoothed images.
            kernel_threshold (float)
                The kernel's impact parameter threshold (by default 1).
            nthreads (int)
                The number of threads to use in the tree search. Default is 1.

        Returns:
            Image : array-like
                A 2D array containing the image.
