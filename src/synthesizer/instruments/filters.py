"""A module holding all photometric transmission filter functionality.

There are two main types of filter object in Synthesizer. Indivdual filters
described by a Filter object and Filters grouped into a FilterCollection.
These objects house all the functionality for working with filters with and
without a grid object.

Example usage::

    filt = Filter("generic/filter.1", transmission=trans, new_lam=lams)
    filt = Filter("top_hat/filter.1", lam_min=3000, lam_max=5500)
    filt = Filter("top_hat/filter.2", lam_eff=7000, lam_fwhm=2000)
    filt = Filter("JWST/NIRCam.F200W", new_lam=lams)
    filters = FilterCollection(
        filter_codes=fs,
        tophat_dict=tophats,
        generic_dict=generics,
        new_lam=lams
    )

    A container for multiple Filter objects.

    Holds a collection of filters (`Filter` objects) and enables various
    quality of life operations such as plotting, adding, looping, len,
    and comparisons as if the collection was a simple list.

    Filters can be derived from the
    `SVO database <http://svo2.cab.inta-csic.es/svo/theory/fps3/>`__
    , specific top hat filter
    properties or generic filter transmission curves and a wavelength array.

    All filters in the `FilterCollection` are defined in terms of the
    same wavelength array.

    In addition to creating `Filter`s from user defined arguments, a HDF5
    file of a `FilterCollection` can be created and later loaded at
    instantiation to load a saved `FilterCollection`.

            A list containing the individual `Filter` objects.
        filter_codes (list, string)
            A list of the names of each filter. For SVO filters these have to
            have the form "Observatory/Instrument.Filter" matching the
            database, but for all other filter types this can be an arbitrary
            label.
