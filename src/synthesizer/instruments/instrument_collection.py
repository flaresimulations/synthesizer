"""A module defining a container for instruments.

A InstrumentCollection is a container for Instrument objects. It can be
treated as a dictionary of instruments, with the label of the instrument
as the key. It can also be treated as an iterable, allowing for simple
iteration over the instruments in the collection.

InstrumentCollections can either be created from an existing file or
initialised as an empty collection to which instruments can be added.

Example usage:

    # Create an empty InstrumentCollection
    collection = InstrumentCollection()

    # Add an instrument to the collection
    instrument = Instrument(label="my_instrument", ...)
    collection.add_instruments(instrument)

    # Add multiple instruments to the collection
    instrument1 = Instrument(label="instrument1", ...)
    instrument2 = Instrument(label="instrument2", ...)
    collection.add_instruments(instrument1, instrument2)

    # Save the collection to a file
    collection.save_instruments("path/to/file.hdf5")

    # Load the collection from a file
    collection = InstrumentCollection("path/to/file.hdf5")

    # Iterate over the instruments in the collection
    for instrument in collection:
        print(instrument.label)

    # Get an instrument by its label
    instrument = collection["my_instrument"]
