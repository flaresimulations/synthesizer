# the component parts of a galaxy. These components include `Stars`, `Gas
# `, and `BlackHoles`.

# ### Replacing young star particles with Parametric Star Formation Histories
#
# For simulations with low mass resolution, the sampling of the star
# formation history can be affected by Poisson scatter. This is
# particularly the case for young star particles; a single massive
# particle that happens to form close to the time of observation can
# significantly alter the integrated colour of the entire galaxy.
#
# To mitigate this, we provide a method for smoothing the recent star
# formation history of a particle galaxy by replacing each young star
# particle with a parametric SFH.
#
# This by calling parametric_young_stars on the Stars object. This method
# will replace the young star particles with particles sampled from a
# parametric SFH. The method requires the age below which to replace the
# particles, the parametric SFH to use, and the grid to use for the
# parametric SFH.

#
# If our grid file has been post-processed with CLOUDY we can produce the

# ## Dust attenuation
#
# We can apply a range of different dust models to our reprocessed spectra. To

# model. To do so we need a dust_curve, for more details on these see the
# dust attenuation docs.

# get_spectra with them 1 by 1. Instead we can make/use large models
# which will generate all the spectra we want at once. For more details
# on making your own models see the emisison models docs. Here we will
# use a premade model that will produce spectra following Charlot&Fall2000

# ### Multiple galaxies
# If we want to create spectra for multiple galaxies and then interact with
# a particular spectra from them all in a single Sed object we can use a list
# comprehension. Here we grab the luminosity `lnu` of each galaxy into a
# list, and combine into a single sed object afterwards using the grid
# wavelength.
specs = np.vstack([g.stars.get_spectra(incident).lnu for g in gals])
specs = Sed(lam=grid.lam, lnu=specs)


# Importantly here, we don't create an SED object for each galaxy spectra
# . We instead create the 2D array of spectra, and then create an `Sed`
# object for the whole collection.

# ### Calculate broadband luminosities
#
# We can then use the `Sed` methods on the whole collection. This is much
# faster than calling the method for each spectra individually, since we
# can take advantage of vectorisation. For example, we can calculate UVJ
# colours of all the selected galaxies in just a couple of lines.
#
# First get rest frame 'flux'

# ## Collective operations
#
# It is often useful to collectively do different operations on a `Galaxy
# `. Synthesizer enables this via some wrapper methods on a galaxy which
# will operate on it's components to, for instance, get the observed
# spectra or photometry for all spectra nested in a `Galaxy`.

# Get observed spectra for all spectra
g.get_observed_spectra(cosmo=cosmo)

# Get UVJ photometry for all spectra
g.get_photo_lnu(fc)
g.get_photo_fnu(fc)
